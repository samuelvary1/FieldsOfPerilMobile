Any clues about objects you can pick up are usually going to be mentioned here. However, some items or clues may be discovered by typing 'look' or 'look closer'.\n\n* There is an important container system in the game - boxes, treasure chests and the like can be opened and searched for important items and clues.\n\n* Access points are a system in the game that must be solved in order to proceed to certain locations. Some access points are keypads, which must be opened with the correct numerical code, and some access points are locked doors that must be opened by discovering the correct key somewhere in the game.\n\n* Certain riddles may contain keypad codes by translating the answer into numbers, i.e. A = 1, B = 2, etc.\n\n* You may encounter characters in the game that will give you important items, keypad codes, or keys if you answer a question that they ask you correctly, or you give them an item that they want that you've discovered somewhere else in the game.\n\n* Type 'help' or 'h' for a list of available in-game commands.\n\n* This is more Monkey Island than King's Quest: You can't die, you can only get stuck.\n\n* To get the game rolling, you'll want to open the wooden chest in the apartment living room, check inside of the wooden chest for clues.\n\n\n GOOD LUCK! :)"
